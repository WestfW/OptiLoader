Optiloader is a sketch designed for bulk upgrading of Arduino board
bootloaders using another Arduino as a device programmer.  It stores
multiple copies of the optiboot bootloader in program flash memory.  When
run (ie by hitting reset), it probes the target device, figures out the type
of CPU (ATmega8, ATmega168, ATmega328, ATmega328P) and initiates upload of
the bootloader and appropriate fuse programming.  Since optiLoader runs
entirely with the Arduino and there is no communications with a host PC
required, this can procede very rapidly, and is not subject to interference
of (for example) avrdude with auto-reset.

The internal copies of the bootloader are prepare manually from the .hex
files compiled in the bootloader directories.  (There's an easy editor macro
process, but it is manual.)

While communication with a host PC is not required, the sketch does send
status information to the serial port at 19200bps.  Here's a sample:
